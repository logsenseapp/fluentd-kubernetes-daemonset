# LogSense agent for Kubernetes logs collection

The following Kubernetes logs collector can be used to push your Kubernetes logs to LogSense.

## How to run it
Setting this up is as easy as two `kubectl` commands:

```
kubectl create secret -n kube-system generic logsense-token --from-literal=logsense-token=YOUR-LOGSENSE-TOKEN-HERE

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logsenseapp/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset/master/logsense-daemonset.yaml
```

### RBAC rules
If your cluster uses RBAC Authorization then you need to use some additional configuration. In such case please use the following spec file:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logsenseapp/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset/master/logsense-daemonset-rbac.yaml
```

## How does it work
The deamonset creates a logging agent pod on every node of the Kubernetes cluster and takes care of the logs collection and distribution.

It uses the https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset[Fluentd Kubernetes DeamonSet] underneath.
